### Challenge 
For this analysis, I created two separate charts. The first, charts the likelihood of success, failure, or cancellation of a kickstarter campaign for plays based on funding goals. The second charts the likelihood of success, failure, cancellation, or being live for play kickstarters based on the start date of the campaign. Both charts are provided below with further analysis.

This chart above details a kickstarter campaign's chance of success based on the campaign's financing goals. Generally, we can see that a campaigns chance of success is inversely related to the amount of money it aims to raise. This makes sense, as higher fundraising goals are more difficult to reach. One peculiarity in the data that is worth noting is that campaigns in the goal range of $35,000 to $45,000 had a very high rate of success (about 2/3 were success). This seems to go against the conclusions of the rest of the chart. The fact of the matter is there are only a handful of data points in this range, so these results are probably unreliable.

This second chart plots the relationship between kickstarter campaign's outcomes relative to what month they were started in. We can see from the chart that May was the month with largest number of successful kickstarter campaign launches (followed by June). From this graph, we can also see that December is the month with the lowest number of successful campaigns. From this line chart, we are able to see that there is a higher concentration of successful kickstarter campaigns in the late spring and summer months, as opposed to beginning and end of the year.
