# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise's campaign.

### Challenge 
For this analysis, I created two separate charts. The first charts the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter campaigns for plays based on funding goals. The second charts the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live play kickstarters according to the start date of the campaign. Both charts are provided below with further analysis.

This chart above details kickstarter campaign outcomes based on financing goals. Generally, we can see that the number of successful campaigns is inversely related to financing goal amount. This makes sense, as higher fundraising goals are more difficult to reach. One peculiarity in the data set that is worth noting is that campaigns in the goal range of $35,000 to $45,000 had a very high rate of success (about 2/3 were successful). This seems to go against the conclusions of the rest of the chart. It is important to note that there are only a handful of data points in this range, so these results are probably unreliable. To rectify this, it may be worthwhile to investigate other kickstarter campaign types and see whether this inverse relationship between chance of success and financing goals holds.

This second chart plots the relationship between kickstarter campaign outcomes relative to campaign start month. We can see from the chart that May was the month with largest number of successful kickstarter campaign launches (followed by June). From this graph, we can also see that December is the month with the lowest number of successful campaigns. From this line chart, we are able to see that there is a higher concentration of successful kickstarter campaigns in the late spring and summer months, as opposed to beginning and end of the year. One peculiarity in this data set is that there are no play kickstarter campaigns that have been cancelled. This seems bizarre given the high number of campaigns, and should probably be further investigated, as otherwise we are unable to gauge what relationship (if any) exists between a kickstarter's launch date and chance of cancellation.

In order to further analyze the best method for Louise to raise money for her kickstarter, I would suggest adding two new analyses. The first would be to include a chart detailing the relationship between campaign outcomes and the amount of time between the campaign's start date and the start of production. This would be of interest because it would allow Louise to see whether a shorter time to production would potentially draw more interest to her campaign as opposed to one where the start of production is not in the immediate future.
The second would be a chart comparing a campaign's length to its chance of success. This would be of interest as it would allow Louise to see the ideal length of a potential campaign.
