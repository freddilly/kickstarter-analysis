### Challenge 
For this analysis, I created two separate charts. The first, charts the likelihood of success, failure, or cancellation of a kickstarter campaign for plays based on funding goals. The second charts the likelihood of success, failure, cancellation, or being live for play kickstarters based on the start date of the campaign. Both charts are provided below with further analysis.
